Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
- It is an object based storage i.e. it allows you to upload files
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB with unlimited storage
- It is a universal namespace i.e names must be unique globally.
- When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.

-S3 objects-
Think of objects just as files. Objects consists of the following :
- Key [The name of the object]
- Value [The data and is made of sequence of bytes]
- Version ID [Important for versioning]
- Metadata [Data about data you are storing]
- Subresources :
  - Access Control Lists [Permissions to objects of a bucket]
  - Torrent

How does data consistency works for S3? [-S3 DATA CONSISTENCY MODEL-]
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects [If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data]
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES, can take some time [If you update an EXISTING FILE or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version
or you may not. Basically, changes to an object can take a little time to propagate]

-S3 guarantees :-
- Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
- Amazon guarantees 99.9% avalability
- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for S3 information (Remember 11*9's)

Features of S3 :
- Tiered Storage Classes
- Storage management
  - S3 Lifecycle
  - S3 Object Lock
  - S3 Replication
  - S3 Batch Operations [Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. You can use Batch Operations to perform 
                         operations such as Copy, Invoke AWS Lambda function, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.]

-S3 Storage Classes-
- S3 Standard [99.99 availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and designed to loss of 2 facilities 
             concurrently.] 
- S3-IA(Infrequently Accessed) [For data that is accessed les frequently, but requires rapid action when needed. Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee. Sometimes
                                refered to as Reduced Redundancy Storage.]
- S3 One Zone-IA [For where you want a lower cost option for infrequenty accessed data, but do not require the multiple AZ data resiliency]
- S3 Intelligent Tiering [Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead]
- S3 Glacier [It is secure, durable and low cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably tore any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than 
               on-premises solutions. Retrieval time configurable from minutes to hours]
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive [Amazon S3's owest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hrs is acceptable]

How we are charged for S3?
- Storage
- Requests 
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data Transparency
- Tranfer Acceleration [Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a bucket-level feature that enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client
                        and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of the globally distributed edge locations in Amazon CloudFront. As the data arrives at an edge 
                        location, the data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.]
                        Why use Transfer Acceleration?
                        You might want to use Transfer Acceleration on a bucket for various reasons:
                        - Your customers upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.
                        - You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.
                        - You can't use all of your available bandwidth over the internet when uploading to Amazon S3.
- Cross Region Replication [To automatically replicate new objects as they are written to the bucket use live replication, such as Same-Region Replication (SRR) or Cross-Region
                            Replication (CRR).To enable SRR or CRR, you add a replication configuration to your source bucket. The minimum configuration must provide the following:
                             - The destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects
                             - An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf]

Note : Since, S3 is an object storage its not suitable to install an OS or a database on. For that we will want block based storage.
       When you view your bucket, view them globally but you can have bucket in individual regions.
       Restricting Bucket Access :
       - Bucket Policies 
       - Object Policies
       - IAM policies to users and groups
       
S3 storage class in decreasing order of their cost : S3 Standard > S3-IA > S3 Intelligent Tiering > S3 One Zone IA > S3 Glacier > S3 Glacier Deep Archive

-S3 Security and Encryption-
By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE. You can setup access control to your buckets by using :
- Bucket policies at bucket level
- ACL's at object level
Note : S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all the requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be sent to another bucket and even another 
in another account.

-Encryption Ways-
Encryption in Transit is achieved by :
- SSL/TLS
Encryption at rest(Server side) is achieved by :
- S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 (Server side encryption - S3)     AWS Key
- AWS Key management service, managed keys - SSE-KMS         AWS+Customer Key
- Server Side Encryption with customer provided keys - SSE-C Customer Key
Client side Encryption
