Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. 
- It is an object based storage i.e. it allows you to upload files
- The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.
- Files can be from 0 bytes to 5TB with unlimited storage
- It is a universal namespace i.e names must be unique globally.
- When you upload a file to S3 you will receive a HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.

-S3 objects-
Think of objects just as files. Objects consists of the following :
- Key [The name of the object]
- Value [The data and is made of sequence of bytes]
- Version ID [Important for versioning]
- Metadata [Data about data you are storing]
- Subresources :
  - Access Control Lists [Permissions to objects of a bucket]
  - Torrent

How does data consistency works for S3? [-S3 DATA CONSISTENCY MODEL-]
- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects [If you write a new file and read it immediately afterwards, you will be able to view that data]
- Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES, can take some time [If you update an EXISTING FILE or delete a file and read it immediately, you may get the older version
or you may not. Basically, changes to an object can take a little time to propagate]

-S3 guarantees :-
- Built for 99.99% availability for S3 platform
- Amazon guarantees 99.9% avalability
- Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999% durability for S3 information (Remember 11*9's)

Features of S3 :
- Tiered Storage Classes
- Storage management
  - S3 Lifecycle
  - S3 Object Lock
  - S3 Replication
  - S3 Batch Operations [Manage billions of objects at scale with a single S3 API request or a few clicks in the Amazon S3 console. You can use Batch Operations to perform 
                         operations such as Copy, Invoke AWS Lambda function, and Restore on millions or billions of objects.]

-S3 Storage Classes-
- S3 Standard [99.99 availability, 99.99999999999% durability, stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities and designed to loss of 2 facilities 
             concurrently.] 
- S3-IA(Infrequently Accessed) [For data that is accessed les frequently, but requires rapid action when needed. Lower fee than S3 but you are charged a retrieval fee. Sometimes
                                refered to as Reduced Redundancy Storage.]
- S3 One Zone-IA [For where you want a lower cost option for infrequenty accessed data, but do not require the multiple AZ data resiliency]
- S3 Intelligent Tiering [Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to most cost effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead]
- S3 Glacier [It is secure, durable and low cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably tore any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than 
               on-premises solutions. Retrieval time configurable from minutes to hours]
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive [Amazon S3's owest cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 hrs is acceptable]

How we are charged for S3?
- Storage
- Requests 
- Storage Management Pricing
- Data Transparency
- Tranfer Acceleration
- Cross Region Replication [To automatically replicate new objects as they are written to the bucket use live replication, such as Same-Region Replication (SRR) or Cross-Region
                            Replication (CRR).To enable SRR or CRR, you add a replication configuration to your source bucket. The minimum configuration must provide the following:
                             - The destination bucket or buckets where you want Amazon S3 to replicate objects
                             - An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 can assume to replicate objects on your behalf]
